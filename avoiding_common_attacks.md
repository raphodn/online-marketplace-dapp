# Avoiding Common Attacks

Info:
- Explain what measures youâ€™ve taken to ensure that your contracts are not susceptible to common attacks
- Module 9 Lesson 3

## Response

Lack of time, did not take overly complex measures.

Nevertheless:
- used the Owned inheritance contract
- checked possible Reentrancy pitfalls
- code is not timestamp dependant
- no while loops

To do/improve:
- Integer management: Overflow and Underflow
- possibility to kill contracts cleanly
- contract fallback functions
